PIZZA INVENTORY MANAGEMENT - PHASE 1

Resources Used:
I did use a variety of resources to aid me in this assignment such as:
- ChatGPT (OpenAI) for planning file structure and for help fixing errors in my code.
- [cplusplus.com](https://www.cplusplus.com/) and [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/) for syntax clarification on classes, operators, and vectors.
Optional Summary:
Luckly, a lot of things went well such as there being clean separation of concerns between header and implementation. Operator overloading was easier than expected. This was due to me doing Assignment 24 before this project so it defititely helped in minimizing errors and maximizing efficiency. However, there were a few challenges which were basic syntax errors and spending some time figuring out errors. Additionally, it was challenging remembering when to use "const" for getters and overloads. Other than that, phase 1 of the project went well!
